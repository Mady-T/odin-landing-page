# odin-landing-page
A first attempt at creating a modern-looking web page

Here, I create a fictional cat-lover website, according to the template specification of The Odin Project's landing page project.

There are no interactive elements in this page, since I only know html and css at this point of time; The buttons and links are all, therefore defunt.

In this exercise I practice:
- HTML
    + Advanced Structuring
- CSS
    + Flexbox
